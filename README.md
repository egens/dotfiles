Dotfiles
========
This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.  They should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.  The included setup
script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located
in `~/dotfiles/`.

The setup script is smart enough to back up your existing dotfiles into a
`~/dotfiles_old/` directory if you already have any dotfiles of the same name as
the dotfile symlinks being created in your home directory.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/egens/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```
